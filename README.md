Reviving this project, but as a rails app.

I judged a b-boy battle last night and the competitors are typically organized through a bracket system.  So this will be an app that incorporates CRUD with a tournament bracket, with many features that I think would be nice to have.  Ultimately, this is for me to learn a new stack of languages while having some fun.

Features: User Registration, Competitor Creation, Drag and drop competitors, double elimination with loser's bracket, export bracket feature so brackets can be displayed in a neat format, cool CSS, and many more to come.
